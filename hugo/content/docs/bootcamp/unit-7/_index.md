# Module 7: Proto.Actor Remote.

## Concepts you'll learn.

So far, we have considered the methods of creating a system of actors on only one node. In this chapter, we will learn techniques and examples of horizontal scaling applications using the Proto.Actor platform.

First, we will look at some common terms and approaches to horizontal scaling supported in the Proto.Actor platform. Then, you will become introduced to the Proto.Remote module and how it organizes actor-to-actor communication over a network.
