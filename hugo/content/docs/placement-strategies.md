# Cluster placement patterns

## How do I make an actor that:

### Is unique for a given ID

Use a virtual actor with the ID as part of its name.

```mermaid
graph TB

    a1((Player1))
    a2((Player5))
    b1((Player7))
    b2((Player9))
    c1((Player3))
    c2((Player6))
    d1((Player2))
    d2((Player4))

    subgraph Member1
        a1
        a2
    end
    subgraph Member 2
        b1
        b2
    end
    subgraph Member 3
        c1
        c2
    end
    subgraph Member 4
        d1
        d2
    end

    a1-->a2
    b1-->b2
    c1-->c2
    d1-->d2
    linkStyle default display:none;
```

**Use-case:** e.g. Players, monsters, user accounts .

### Is a cluster singleton

Use a virtual actor with a known name.

```mermaid
graph TD

    s((Singleton))

    subgraph Member 1
        empty1
    end
    subgraph Member 2
        empty2
    end
    subgraph Member 3
        s
    end
    subgraph Member 4
        empty3
    end
```

**Use-case:** e.g. a manager actor of some sort, that manages work for the entire cluster.

### Always exist on each member

Use a normal actor, boot on startup.
Use MemberList to see what members exist when communicating with these actors.

```mermaid
graph TB

    a1((Worker1))

    b1((Worker2))

    c1((Worker3))

    d1((Worker4))

    subgraph Member 1
        a1
    end
    subgraph Member 2
        b1
    end
    subgraph Member 3
        c1
    end
    subgraph Member 4
        d1
    end
```

**Use-case:** e.g. a worker actor that performs maintenance work for each cluster member.
