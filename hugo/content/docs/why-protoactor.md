# Why Proto.Actor?

## What features can the Proto.Actor platform offer over the competition?
Proto.Actor provides scalable, real-time transaction processing.

Proto.Actor is a unified runtime and programming model for:

* Scale up (Concurrency)
* Scale out (Remote)
* Fault tolerance

With one thing to learn and admin, with high cohesion and coherent semantics.

Proto.Actor is a very scalable piece of software; not only in the context of performance, but also in the size of applications it is useful for. The core of Proto.Actor, Proto.Actor-Actor, is very small, and it can easily be dropped into an existing project where you need asynchronicity and lockless concurrency without hassle.

You can choose to include only the parts of Proto.Actor you need in your application, or you can use the whole package with persistence and clustering.

## What's a good use case for Proto.Actor?

We see Proto.Actor being adopted by many large organizations in a wide range of industries:

* Investment and Merchant Banking
* Retail
* Social Media
* Simulation
* Gaming and Betting
* Automobile and Traffic Systems
* Health Care
* Data Analytics

And many more. Any system with the need for high throughput and low latency is a good candidate for using Proto.Actor.

Actors let you manage service failures (Supervisors), load management (back-off strategies, timeouts and processing-isolation), as well as both horizontal and vertical scalability (add more cores and/or add more machines).

All this in the ApacheV2-licensed open source project.
